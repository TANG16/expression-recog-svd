expression-recog-svd
====================

A MATLAB project that recognizes facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral)
by applying Singular Value Decomposition to the face images.

If you need to run the code, please make sure you have the .mat files containing required variables.
e.g. "face_p146_small.mat"
Please contact "r_cajetan<at>yahoo<dot>com" to get these .mat files

Also you obviously need to have a database of face images (preferably jpg).
Please type a file called "CFS.txt" in which each line contains the full path of these images.
Adjust the conditions in the classification section of GUI.m to reflect the sequence and count of these images.

For queries, please contact "r_cajetan<at>yahoo<dot>com"
